# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing9

This project involves a simple Python project with unit tests using Pytest.  These instructions will guide you through setting up GitHub Actions for automated testing.

**1. Adding the Workflow File**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This is the standard location for GitHub Actions workflows.  The following content will run the tests on every push to the main branch:


```yaml
name: Run Python tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9' #Or your desired Python version
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
```

**2. Environment Variables (None needed for this project)**

No environment variables are required for this project.

**3. Dependencies**

The project explicitly lists `pytest` as a dependency.

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Pytest)**

The provided `.github/workflows/test.yml` file installs `pytest` automatically.  Your `test_main.py` file needs to import the functions from `main.py` correctly, as demonstrated in the code analysis.  Ensure the `pytest` command is used correctly within the YAML file to execute your tests.


**5. Viewing Test Results**

GitHub Actions will display the test results directly in the Actions tab of your repository.  A successful run will show a green checkmark, indicating that the tests passed.  Failed tests will display an error message, along with the specific test case that failed.

**6. Troubleshooting**

* **`ModuleNotFoundError`:**  Make sure that your `main.py` and `test_main.py` files are in the same directory or that the correct import path is used.
* **`pip` issues:** Verify that `pip` is installed and working correctly within the workflow environment.  If you encounter issues, check the `pip install` command in the workflow file.
* **Permissions:** Ensure that the GitHub Actions runner has the necessary permissions to access and execute the tests.

**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps (None needed for this project)**

This project structure does not require any additional configuration steps.

**Important Considerations (Specific to Python projects):**

* **`requirements.txt`:** Consider creating a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. This is a best practice for larger projects or when using virtual environments.
* **Virtual Environments:** For enhanced project management, using virtual environments is highly recommended in your local development setup and within the GitHub Actions workflow for isolation and reproducibility.  You can add a `venv` step to create and activate it if you desire.

**Key Recommendations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Add `try...except` blocks to your Python functions to handle potential exceptions gracefully and produce informative error messages.
* **Code Style:** Implement a code style (like PEP 8) for consistency. Tools like `flake8` can be integrated into your workflow for automated style checking.


These steps should help you successfully integrate GitHub Actions into your Python project. Remember to commit and push these changes to your repository for the workflow to run. Remember to replace placeholder file names (e.g., `main.py`, `test_main.py`) with your actual file names. Remember to add your files (`main.py`, `test_main.py`) to the repository.

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
