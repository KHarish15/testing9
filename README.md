# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing9

This project uses an HTML login form with Playwright for testing.  Since there's no backend, testing focuses on the frontend form's functionality.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This file will define the GitHub Actions workflow.

```yaml
name: Test Login Page

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or your main branch name

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Playwright
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16' # Or the specific Node.js version Playwright needs
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install playwright
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        id: run-playwright
        run: |
          npx playwright test --expect-failures ./
      - name: Display Test Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-results
          path: playwright-results # Adjust if Playwright output directory changes
      - name: Download test results
        if: steps.run-playwright.outputs.test-results != '[]'
        run: echo "Test results found. See the artifacts."
```

**2. Environment Variables (None needed for this project):**

No environment variables are required for this project.

**3. Dependencies:**

Playwright is the only dependency:

```bash
npm install playwright
```

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Playwright):**

a. **Install Playwright:** The provided `test.yml` file already includes the npm install step.

b. **Test Files:** Create a `playwright.config.js` file (you can use the default).

c. **Write Playwright Tests:** Create a file named `test/login.spec.js` and use Playwright commands to test the login form:

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Login Test Cases', async ({ page }) => {
    //  Replace placeholders with actual selectors from the HTML
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
    await page.locator('input[name="email"]').type("john.doe@example.com");
    await page.locator('input[name="password"]').type("P@ssw0rd123");
    await page.locator('button').click();
    // Add assertions to verify the expected result
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/success'); // or your success page URL
  });

});

```

**5. Viewing Test Results:**

GitHub Actions will upload the test results as an artifact.  Look in the "Artifacts" tab of the workflow run. The provided workflow now automatically looks for `playwright-results` and displays a message if there are test results.


**6. Troubleshooting:**

* **No tests found:** Double-check the paths in your Playwright test files.  Ensure the test files match the project structure.
* **Playwright installation errors:** Use the correct node version (`node-version`) and npm version if needed.
* **Browser compatibility:** Playwright supports various browsers. Ensure the chosen browser works for your tests.
* **HTML validation errors:** Use a tool like [validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) to ensure your HTML is valid before running Playwright tests locally.

**7. Project-Specific Configuration:**

a. **Local Server:** Start a simple web server (e.g., with `http-server`):
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server . -p 3000
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to test.  (Change port if needed.)


b. **Playwright Installation:** Follow the instructions in the Playwright documentation for installing the Playwright CLI.



c. **HTML Validation:**  Use a validator like validator.nu, W3C Markup Validation Service, or similar to catch invalid HTML markup. Validate your `index.html` locally.

d. **Cross-browser Testing:**  Playwright's advantage is that it works across browsers.  Run your tests against Chrome, Firefox, and Safari if needed.


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Selectors:**  Ensure your Playwright selectors accurately target the elements in your HTML.
*   **Assertions:** Implement robust assertions in your Playwright tests to validate user interactions and expected behavior.
*   **Error Handling:** Add error handling (using `try...catch`) in your test code to prevent unexpected failures.
*   **Code Coverage:** While not explicit in the prompt, consider adding code coverage to ensure thorough testing.

This setup provides a robust framework to test the login form in your HTML application. Remember to adjust the paths and selectors according to your specific code structure. Remember to replace placeholders with your specific file and URL names.
